## Introduction
To give some background on the purpose and reason for the use of this calculator. I made this subnet calculator when I was taking a Network Fundamentals course at Purdue Univsertiy. This course had several "subnetting assignments" that tasked be with the work of taking a Host IP, a major network mask, as well as a subnet mask. With this input of information I had to then perform bitwise operation to find several piece of information (as shown in table 1). 

|   Variable | Example Value  |
|--------|------|
|    Host IP Address | 219.2.3.201   |
|  Major Network Mask | 255.255.0.0   |
|  Major Ntwork Address | 219.2.0.0  |
|  Major Network Broadcast Address | 219.2.255.255   |
|  CIDR Notation Major Network | 219.2.0.0/16   |
|  Number of Host Bits | 16   |
|  Number of Hosts | 65,534   |
