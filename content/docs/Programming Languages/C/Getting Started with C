## Introduction to C Programming
C programming is structured around functions and a comprehensive standard library

## Identifiers in C
Identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, etc. They are categorized into:

**Reserved Words (keywords):** Predefined keywords in C that cannot be used for other purposes.
| Keywords              | 
| :---------------- | 
| auto  default float   register    struct  volatile  | 
| break do  for return  swtich  while          | 
| case  double  goto    short   typedef    | 
| char  else    if  signed  union |
| const enum    int sizeof  unsigned |
| continue  extern  long    static  void |

**Standard Identifiers:** Predefined names in the standard library (e.g., printf).
| C Standard Identifiers              | 
| :---------------- | 
| abs   fopen   isalpah rand    strcpy | 
| argc  free    malloc  reqind  strlen | 
| argv  fseek   memcpy  scanf   tolower | 
| calloc    gets  printf  sin  toupper |
| fclose    isacii  puts    strcat  ungetc |

**Programmer-Created Identifiers:** Custom names defined by the programmer.
Rules for identifiers:
- Must start with a letter or underscore (_).
- Can include letters, digits, or underscores.
- Cannot contain spaces 
- Cannot be a reserved words.
- C is case-sensitive (e.g., TOTAL and total are different).
