## Population vs Sample

1. **Population**
   * The entire group of "entities" that we want information about.
   * A **parameter** is a population measure.
   * *Example*: The population could be all students in a university, all residents in a city, or all rats in the New York subway system.
2. **Sample**
   * A subset of the population that we actually examine to gather information.
   * A **statistic** is a sample measure.
   * *Example*: A sample could be a group of 100 students selected from the 
3. **Population vs. Sample**
   * **Population** refers to the complete set of all entities of interest.
   * **Sample** refers to a smaller, manageable subset drawn from the population for study.
   * The goal is to infer information about the population (parameters) based on the sample (statistics).

## Terminology of Experimental Design
1. **Experimental Unit**
   * The individual or entity that receives a treatment in an experiment.
   * Example: A person, animal, plant, or object involved in the study.
2. **Sample Size**
   * The number of experimental units or subjects in the sample.
   * Larger sample sizes generally increase the reliability of the results by reducing variability.
3. **Response Variable(s)**
   * The outcomes or measurements that are observed and recorded in the study.
   * *Example*: Blood pressure, cholesterol levels, or test scores after a treatment.
4. **Factor(s)**
   * Variables that are manipulated in an experiment to determine their effect on the response variable(s).
   * *Example*: In a drug trial, the type of drug administered is a factor.
5. **Levels**
   * Different states or values that the factors can take.
   * *Example*: If the factor is the type of drug, the levels could be Drug A, Drug B, and a placebo.
6. **Treatment**
   * A specific combination of factors and levels applied to the experimental unit.
   * *Example*: Administering Drug A to one group and Drug B to another group.
7. **Bias**
   * The tendency for results to be skewed in a certain direction due to flaws in the design of the study.

# Lecture 2 (8/21) - Experiments
## Issues in Experimental Design
1. **Lurking Variables**
   * Variables that are not included in the experiment but can influence the final result.
   * *Example*: In a study about diet and weight loss, exercise levels might be a lurking variable that affects the outcome.
2. **Placebo Effect**
   * Occurs when subjects experience a perceived effect from a dummy treatment (such as a sugar pill), due to their expectations rather than the treatment itself.
   * *Example*: In medical studies, the effectiveness of a real drug must be tested against a placebo to account for psychological effects.
3. **Bias**
   * Any factors that systematically skew the results of an experiment. Poor experimental design often introduces bias, leading to inaccurate conclusions.
   * **How to Reduce Bias:**
     * Ensure that evaluators are impartial by using independent evaluators.
     * Blind or double-blind studies ensure neither the evaluators nor the subjects know which treatments were applied to prevent bias.
     * Avoid grouping subjects that are predisposed to perform well in one group (e.g., assigning 5 experienced gamers to a single treatment group).
     * **Randomization**: Randomly assigning subjects to treatment groups helps distribute variability and reduce bias.

## Three Principles of Experimental Design
1. **Randomize**
   * Ensures that every subject has an equal chance of being assigned to any treatment. This spreads out variability among subjects across treatments, reducing bias.
   * *Example*: Assigning treatments to participants randomly in a study of dietary supplements.
2. **Compare**
   * Treatments should be compared to one another or to a control group to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment.
   * *Example*: Comparing the effects of different drugs or a drug versus a placebo.
3. **Repeat**
   * Repetition ensures that the results are not due to random chance. Repeating an experiment increases reliability by reducing variability.
   * *Example*: Conducting the same experiment multiple times with different subjects or in different settings.

## Experimental Designs
1. **Completely Randomized Design**
   * All subjects are randomly assigned to different treatment groups, with no grouping by traits.
2. **Randomized Block Design**
   * Subjects are first grouped into blocks based on similar traits (e.g., age, sex, weight), and then randomly assigned treatments within each block.
   * *Example*: Dividing participants by age and then randomly assigning them to different drug treatments.
3. **Matched Pairs Design**
   * Subjects are paired based on similar characteristics or are measured in different conditions.
   * *Examples*:
     * Matching different individuals with similar traits (e.g., age, weight) into pairs, and giving one member of each pair one treatment and the other member a different treatment.
     * Measuring the same person before and after treatment, or comparing effects on different body parts of the same individual.

## Terminology of Sampling
1. **The noun "Sample"**
   * Refers to a group of subjects selected from the population for the experiment or study.
   * *Example*: A sample of 100 people selected to participate in a dietary study.
2. **The verb "Sample" (or "Sampling")**
   * Refers to the act of selecting individuals from a population to form a group.
   * *Example*: Sampling 100 individuals from a population of 10,000 to form a test group.
3. **Design**
   * Refers to the process of sorting the sample into treatment groups.
   * *Example*: Randomly assigning individuals into different treatment groups after sampling them from the population.

## Experimental vs. Observational Studies
1. **Experimental Study**
   * Involves the deliberate application of treatments to subjects to observe their effects.
   * *Example*: Testing two different drugs on cholesterol levels in participants.
2. **Observational Study**
   * Data is recorded based on what is observed without any manipulation of variables.
   * *Example*: Conducting a poll after participants watch political videos but without assigning specific treatments to participants.

# Lecture 3 (8/26) - Sampling

## Types of Samples
1. **Voluntary Response Sample**
   * Subjects choose themselves to participate in the study.
   * *Example*: Online polls where people decide if they want to respond.
2. **SRS (Simple Random Sample)**
   * A sample where every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
   * *Example*: Drawing names out of a hat where everyone has an equal chance of being chosen.
3. **Stratified Random Sample**
   * The population is divided into groups (called strata) based on shared characteristics. A random sample is then taken from each group.
   * *Example*: Dividing a population by gender and randomly selecting from each group to ensure representation.
   * **Note**: Use strata for observations; use blocks for experiments.
4. **Multistage Random Sample**
   * A sampling method involving multiple levels of randomization.
   * *Example*: Randomly selecting 10 states, then 10 cities within those states, and finally 1000 people from those cities.

## Bias in Sampling
Bias can distort results, especially in observational studies.

1. **Undercoverage Bias**
   * Occurs when some groups in the population are left out of the process of selecting the sample.
   * *Example*: Conducting a survey by phone and excluding individuals who don’t have access to a phone.
2. **Response Bias**
   * Occurs when respondents give inaccurate answers, either intentionally or unintentionally.
   * *Example of lying*: When asked, "How many drinks did you have last week?", respondents might underreport due to social desirability.
   * *Example of misleading wording*: "Don’t you agree that TAs should be paid more?" The question is leading and may sway the respondent's answer.
3. **Non-Response Bias**
   * Occurs when individuals selected for the sample do not respond. If the non-respondents differ in some way from those who respond, this can lead to bias.
   * *Example*: If only people who feel strongly about an issue respond to a survey, the results won’t accurately represent the entire population.
